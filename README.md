## Introduction ##
If you find watching long videos and taking notes from those difficult and exhausting, you are not alone. Many people, especially the younger generation, do not find taking long notes from videos that are 15+ minutes an easy task to do. They may feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the content, or the fact that the instructor has not taught the content well. Zoning out after a few minutes is also a big issue. Therefore, here is **AI, Noted**: an app where users can upload audio clips, where notes, in any format, magically appear with only a few clicks.

## Features ##
AI, Noted has several feature that can help make the AI-generated notes more personal towards you, inclcuding depth and context. Here are some of the features currently available to users:
- An file select box for the user to upload audio clips
- A button where the app can transcribe the audio and extract what the person is saying
- A slider indicating the depth of the notes
- Input box where the user can specify the context and purpose of the notes, allowing more personalized notes
- Five different note formats, which are the Outline Method, the Sentence Method, the Charting Method, the Mind Map Method, and the Cornell method of note-taking.
